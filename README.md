# Employee_tracker
**Description**

The objective of this application is to enable users to browse through employees, roles, and departments within a business. Additionally, the app offers functionality for creating new departments, roles, and employees.

**Usage**

This terminal-based application operates exclusively within the terminal environment. By running the command node index.js, users can initialize the app, prompting a menu of multiple selections. These selections are crafted using the Inquirer npm package, seamlessly integrated with MySQL to facilitate the functionality for viewing and modifying various tables of information.

**Conclusion**

Enhanced Understanding of MySQL and Database Structure: Through working on this project, I deepened my comprehension of MySQL and gained insights into database structuring, which is crucial for effective data management and retrieval.

Thorough Knowledge of Switch Cases: Implementing switch cases in the application has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how they can be utilized to handle multiple scenarios efficiently. This knowledge has been instrumental in creating a more robust and organized codebase.

Creation of Seed Database: I successfully developed a seed database that users can access through table navigation. This process not only facilitated data testing and manipulation but also improved my proficiency in database management and integration with the application.

Strengthened Understanding of Inquirer: Working extensively with the Inquirer npm package has allowed me to strengthen my understanding of its functionalities and capabilities. This has enabled me to create a more user-friendly and interactive experience within the terminal application.
